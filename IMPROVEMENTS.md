# Project Updates and Improvements

## Version Update
- **Updated eframe from 0.27 to 0.32**: This brings the project up to date with the latest egui features and performance improvements.

## Code Improvements Made

### 1. **Better Error Handling and Configuration**
- Added `Default` implementation for `Config` struct
- Improved config loading with graceful fallback to defaults
- Better error messages for invalid color formats
- Config now handles missing files gracefully instead of panicking

### 2. **Improved Metadata Extraction**
- Refactored metadata extraction into dedicated helper functions
- Better handling of D-Bus value types with proper cloning
- More robust artist extraction that handles both single strings and string arrays
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 3. **Enhanced Code Organization**
- Split complex functions into smaller, focused functions
- Better function naming and documentation
- Improved readability of the main application logic

### 4. **API Compatibility**
- Fixed compatibility issues with egui 0.32
- Updated `eframe::run_native` to use the new Result-based callback API
- Fixed `OwnedValue::clone()` to use `try_clone()` for newer zbus versions

## Additional Improvements You Could Consider

### 1. **Performance Optimizations**
- Cache font measurements to avoid recalculating on every frame
- Use `ctx.request_repaint_after()` with longer intervals when no media is playing
- Implement proper text truncation with ellipsis for very long titles

### 2. **Feature Enhancements**
- Add support for album art display
- Show playback position/duration
- Add keyboard shortcuts for media control
- Support for multiple monitor setups with per-monitor positioning

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**
- Add fade-in/fade-out animations when track changes
- Implement smooth scrolling for long text
- Add a separator between artist and title (e.g., " - ")
- Make the artist color configurable

### 4. **Configuration Enhancements**
- Add opacity/transparency settings
- Configurable window size
- Theme support with predefined color schemes
- Font family and size configuration

### 5. **Code Quality**
- Add unit tests for metadata extraction functions
- Add integration tests for D-Bus communication
- Implement proper logging with the `log` crate
- Add command-line argument support

### 6. **Cross-Platform Support**
- Add Windows Media Session support
- macOS Now Playing support
- Better handling of different D-Bus implementations

## Example Additional Config Options

```toml
# Extended config example
[display]
opacity = 0.9
font_family = "Inter"
font_size_range = [8, 18]
separator = " - "
fade_duration_ms = 200

[colors]
title_color = "#FFFFFF"
artist_color = "#B0B0B0"
background_color = "#000000"
theme = "dark"  # or "light", "custom"

[behavior]
update_interval_ms = 500
hide_when_paused = false
show_album_art = true
```

The project is now updated and should work well with the latest egui version while being more robust and maintainable.
